# Azure Backup Smart Tiering automation

An audit-first Azure Automation runbook that finds Azure VM backup policies where Vault Archive
Smart Tiering is missing or disabled and enables `TierRecommended` without changing schedule,
retention or tags. Version 1.1 adds the guards that an adversarial review of 1.0 found missing:
an archive-eligibility gate, per-policy error isolation, a fail-closed apply contract, terminal
tracking of the asynchronous update, and full post-write verification.

> **Status:** 1.1 is live-qualified on the same empty-canary fixture as 1.0 (2026-08-25: unfiltered
> audit, `DoNotTier` → `TierRecommended` apply, idempotent repeat, and every fail-closed guard) and is
> validated offline by a 45-scenario behavioural harness that executes the real runbook against a
> mocked ARM transport. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and [docs/validation.md](docs/validation.md) for exactly
> what has and has not been proven live.

## Start here

| Your goal | Follow this path |
|---|---|
| Deploy and understand this Backup Automation canary | [Standalone walkthrough](docs/replicate-in-azure.md): tools, permissions, exact commands, expected results, recovery, and cleanup |
| Deploy the Policy + Automation showcase together | [Combined walkthrough](https://github.com/kevo099/azure-enterprise-policy-baseline/blob/main/docs/REPLICATE-POLICY-AUTOMATION.md); it owns the shared resource group |
| Inspect an existing deployment | [Portal inspection guide](docs/inspection-guide.md); no deployment required |
| Review the code without deploying | [Local validation](#local-validation) and [recorded qualification](docs/validation.md) |

For your first deployment, keep the chosen walkthrough open and follow it in order. The examples
below explain individual operations and are not a second end-to-end deployment procedure.

## What it changes

Smart Tiering is configured on each Recovery Services vault child backup policy — not on the vault:

```text
Microsoft.RecoveryServices/vaults/backupPolicies
```

For Azure VM policies the intended change is:

```json
{
  "tieringPolicy": {
    "ArchivedRP": {
      "tieringMode": "TierRecommended"
    }
  }
}
```

| Policy state | Audit result | Apply behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| Not an Azure VM policy (SQL, SAP HANA, files) | `SkippedUnsupportedWorkload` | No write |
| Vault is zone-redundant | `SkippedZoneRedundantVault` | No write (archive tier is unsupported on ZRS) |
| `TierRecommended` | `AlreadyCompliant` | No write |
| `TierAfter` | `AlreadyEnabledAlternateMode` | Preserved; no write |
| Unknown / `Invalid` mode | `SkippedUnknownMode` | No write |
| No monthly/yearly retention of at least `MinimumRetentionMonths` (9) | `SkippedNoArchiveEligibility` | No write — nothing in the policy can ever reach the archive tier |
| Protected-item count missing from the API response | `SkippedProtectedItemsUnknown` | No write — fail closed |
| Protects more items than `MaxProtectedItemsPerPolicy` (0) | `SkippedProtectedItemsExceedLimit` | No write until the limit is raised deliberately |
| Protects items and the API returned no ETag | `SkippedNoConcurrencyToken` | No write unless `AllowWriteWithoutETag=true` |
| Missing or `DoNotTier`, eligible | `WouldEnableTierRecommended` | Set `TierRecommended`, follow the operation, verify → `EnabledAndVerified` |

Writes are only attempted with `Apply=true`, and only after the whole scope has been classified
and the preflight guards (below) pass. A vault whose storage redundancy cannot be read is reported
as an error and its policies are not evaluated; any discovery error aborts an apply run before the
first write.

## Why this exists

Azure provides a Portal control and the `Set-AzRecoveryServicesBackupProtectionPolicy` cmdlet, but
no field-level Smart Tiering `PATCH`, vault-wide switch, built-in Azure Policy remediation, or
dedicated CLI flag for existing policies. REST and CLI updates operate on a complete backup policy,
and modifying a policy that protects items re-applies it to every one of those items.

This runbook adds the orchestration needed to do that safely for one policy at a time, or for a
bounded, reviewed set:

- system-assigned managed-identity authentication (no Az modules, no secrets);
- audit-only by default;
- exact vault and policy filters that fail closed (a blank or misspelled filter never widens scope);
- eligibility, protected-item and change-count guards evaluated before the first write;
- fresh reads before mutation and a structural pre-write comparison;
- the asynchronous update followed to a terminal state;
- tags preserved and every non-tiering property verified after the write;
- per-policy error isolation and honest write accounting (submitted / verified / failed / unknown);
- idempotent repeat execution.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription (commercial Azure — the runbook uses `management.azure.com` and the
  public identity audience; sovereign clouds are not supported) where you can create the
  isolated test resources.
- Subscription-level permission to create the new resource group; Contributor on the canary group
  for its resources and runbook; Owner or User Access Administrator on that group for custom-role
  definitions and assignments, including revocation. Contributor alone cannot write RBAC.
- Linux or WSL with Bash 4 or newer, Git, `curl`, `jq`, and GNU coreutils (`sort -V` and `sha256sum`).
  The role helpers also require Linux `/proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid`; native macOS is not supported.
- Azure CLI 2.75.0 or newer with the experimental `automation` extension pinned
  to the qualified version `1.0.0b2`.
- Bicep CLI and local PowerShell 7.4 for validation. The Bicep fixture creates the separate
  PowerShell 7.4 Runtime Environment in Azure Automation (no packages required).
- A deliberate RBAC and change-approval decision before applying beyond a canary resource group.

See [walkthrough Step 0](docs/replicate-in-azure.md#0-prerequisites-and-source-pin) for installation
links, version checks, the immutable source pin, and explicit tenant/subscription selection.

## Deploy the empty test fixture

Create a **new, empty** resource group, then deploy the Bicep fixture. The deployment is
incremental: if a vault or policy with the same name already exists it will be **overwritten**,
so use names that do not exist anywhere in the subscription.

```bash
set -euo pipefail
SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<subscription-id>"
TEST_RESOURCE_GROUP="<test-resource-group>"
AZURE_REGION="<azure-region>"
RG_CANARY_VAULT="<rg-canary-vault>"
SUBSCRIPTION_CANARY_VAULT="<subscription-canary-vault>"
AUTOMATION_ACCOUNT="<automation-account>"

test "$(az group exists \
  --subscription "$SUBSCRIPTION_ID" \
  --name "$TEST_RESOURCE_GROUP")" = "false"

az group create \
  --subscription "$SUBSCRIPTION_ID" \
  --name "$TEST_RESOURCE_GROUP" \
  --location "$AZURE_REGION" \
  --output none

# Fails if the newly created group is not still empty in the exact subscription.
test "$(az resource list \
  --subscription "$SUBSCRIPTION_ID" \
  --resource-group "$TEST_RESOURCE_GROUP" \
  --query 'length(@)' -o tsv)" = "0"

az deployment group create \
  --subscription "$SUBSCRIPTION_ID" \
  --resource-group "$TEST_RESOURCE_GROUP" \
  --template-file infra/test-environment.bicep \
  --parameters \
    resourceGroupScopeVaultName="$RG_CANARY_VAULT" \
    subscriptionScopeVaultName="$SUBSCRIPTION_CANARY_VAULT" \
    automationAccountName="$AUTOMATION_ACCOUNT" \
    backupPolicyName=smart-tiering-remediation-canary \
    testPolicyTieringMode=TierRecommended \
    retainForInspection=true \
  --output none
```

`testPolicyTieringMode=TierRecommended` leaves both canary policies compliant. The replication guide
fetches one exact zero-item policy and seeds only its archive-tier block for the write proof. Do not
re-run the full fixture merely to change a retained policy: Azure-added defaults can introduce an
unrelated update diff.

The Bicep file creates the Automation Account, the PowerShell 7.4 runtime environment, two empty
vaults and one canary policy in each vault. It does **not** import the runbook or create RBAC
definitions/assignments. Each new vault also receives service-created default policies
(`DefaultPolicy`, `EnhancedPolicy`, `HourlyLogBackup`); 1.1 classifies the first two as
`SkippedNoArchiveEligibility` because they have no monthly/yearly retention.

## Publish the runbook

```bash
az automation runbook create \
  --subscription "<subscription-id>" \
  --resource-group "<test-resource-group>" \
  --automation-account-name "<automation-account>" \
  --name Enable-SmartTiering \
  --type PowerShell \
  --location "<azure-region>"

az automation runbook replace-content \
  --subscription "<subscription-id>" \
  --resource-group "<test-resource-group>" \
  --automation-account-name "<automation-account>" \
  --name Enable-SmartTiering \
  --content @src/Enable-SmartTiering.ps1

az automation runbook publish \
  --subscription "<subscription-id>" \
  --resource-group "<test-resource-group>" \
  --automation-account-name "<automation-account>" \
  --name Enable-SmartTiering
```

Link the runbook to the `PowerShell74` runtime environment (the Portal, or the Automation ARM API
`PATCH .../runbooks/Enable-SmartTiering?api-version=2024-10-23` with
`{"properties":{"runtimeEnvironment":"PowerShell74"}}`), and record the SHA-256 of the file you
published so the job evidence can be tied to a commit. `scripts/publish-runbook.sh` does all of this in one
go, discovers the Automation Account's Azure region unless `LOCATION` is explicitly supplied, and
exits non-zero unless the fetch-back SHA-256 equals your local file:

```bash
SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<sub>" RESOURCE_GROUP="<rg>" AUTOMATION_ACCOUNT="<account>" scripts/publish-runbook.sh
```

## RBAC model

For a resource-group run, `scripts/discovery-role.sh grant|revoke` renders a collision-resistant reader
definition whose assignable scope is only that resource group. `scripts/ring-role.sh grant|revoke`
does the temporary remediator half, also with the resource group as its only assignable scope. The
subscription-assignable `infra/rbac/discovery-reader-role.template.json` remains available only for
deliberate `ScopeType=Subscription` discovery.

Assign:

- **Azure Backup Smart Tiering Discovery Reader** — at resource-group scope for
  `ScopeType=ResourceGroup` runs; at subscription scope only when you need
  `ScopeType=Subscription` discovery.
- **Azure Backup Smart Tiering Policy Remediator - `<scope-hash>`** — only at the resource group that contains the
  policies you intend to change.

Be explicit about what the writer role is: `Microsoft.RecoveryServices/Vaults/backupPolicies/write`
is **full policy-update authority**. Anyone who can publish or start this runbook — or any other
runbook in the same account — can change schedules and retention with the managed identity, which
changes how long recovery points live. The role grants no direct delete action, and `NotActions`
cannot restrict permissions granted by another role. Keep the account dedicated, keep the
assignment narrow, and treat "start runbook" permission as writer-equivalent.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SubscriptionId` | required | Subscription to scan |
| `ScopeType` | required | `ResourceGroup` or `Subscription` |
| `ResourceGroupName` | | Required for `ResourceGroup`; **rejected** for `Subscription` (1.0 silently ignored it) |
| `VaultName` | | Exact vault name. A whitespace-only value is rejected, never treated as "no filter" |
| `PolicyName` | | Exact policy name, same rules |
| `Apply` | `false` | Audit only unless `true` |
| `AllowUnfilteredApply` | `false` | `Apply=true` without both filters is refused unless this is `true` |
| `AllowWriteWithoutETag` | `false` | A candidate that protects items but has no ETag is skipped (`SkippedNoConcurrencyToken`) unless this is `true` — set it only inside an exclusive change window |
| `MaxChanges` | `1` | Apply aborts before any write if more policies would change |
| `ExpectedMatches` | `0` | If >0, apply aborts unless exactly this many Azure VM policies matched the filters |
| `MaxProtectedItemsPerPolicy` | `0` | Candidates protecting more items are skipped; raise deliberately |
| `MinimumRetentionMonths` | `9` | Eligibility threshold (minimum 9): monthly/yearly retention needed before any recovery point can become archive-eligible (≥3 months age + ≥6 months left). Only `Months`/`Years` units count |
| `OperationTimeoutSeconds` | `600` | Budget for following the asynchronous update (max 1800) |
| `JobTimeBudgetSeconds` | `8400` | No new write starts after this much job time; the job then fails closed with `SkippedJobBudgetExhausted` rows (Azure Automation stops cloud jobs at three hours) |
| `RequestTimeoutSeconds` | `100` | Per-request timeout |
| `ApiVersion` | `2025-08-01` | Recovery Services API version |

Every result row is one JSON object with `timestamp`, `vaultId`, `policyId`, `policyType`,
`protectedItemsCount`, `retentionHorizonMonths`, `previousMode`, `currentMode`, `action`, `stage`,
`operationStatus` and `message`. Once execution reaches the result section, the last output line is
`SUMMARY {...}` with `policiesMatched`, `candidates`, `policiesWritten` (verified),
`writesSubmitted`, `writesUnknown`, `writesFailed`, `writesSkipped`, `errors` and `abortReason`.
Null values are emitted as JSON `null`.

Failures before that section do not have a summary: parameter binding, script-level parameter
validation, managed-identity token acquisition, and a top-level vault-list failure such as the
expected no-reader 403. Use the Azure Automation job status and Error stream for those failures.
Also distinguish an attempted request from a verified change: a reader-only apply that receives 403
reports `writesSubmitted=1`, `writesFailed=1`, and `policiesWritten=0`.

## Run audit first

```bash
az automation runbook start \
  --subscription "<subscription-id>" \
  --resource-group "<test-resource-group>" \
  --automation-account-name "<automation-account>" \
  --name Enable-SmartTiering \
  --parameters \
    SubscriptionId="<subscription-id>" \
    ScopeType=ResourceGroup \
    ResourceGroupName="<test-resource-group>" \
    VaultName="<rg-canary-vault>" \
    PolicyName=smart-tiering-remediation-canary \
    Apply=false
```

Review the job output. A newly deployed fixture reports `AlreadyCompliant` because both policies
start as `TierRecommended`. A mutation proof requires the exact-policy seed, reader-readiness
check, temporary writer grant, and cleanup in [walkthrough Steps 5–9](docs/replicate-in-azure.md#5-grant-rg-only-reader-access-and-seed-only-the-exact-policy).
That sequence requires one `WouldEnableTierRecommended` audit result, one verified apply, then
zero writes with `AlreadyCompliant` on repeat. With the defaults (`MaxChanges=1`,
`MaxProtectedItemsPerPolicy=0`) the runbook writes at most one empty policy. An audit job alone does
not prove writer authorization or successful remediation.

For subscription discovery, set `ScopeType=Subscription` and omit `ResourceGroupName`. Audit
freely; applying at subscription scope requires `AllowUnfilteredApply=true` or exact filters and
is still bounded by `MaxChanges`.

No recurring schedule is created by this repository.

## Mutation canary track (`DoNotTier` → `TierRecommended`)

Do not redeploy the full retained fixture to seed a write. Follow the exact-policy GET → sanitized
PUT procedure in [docs/replicate-in-azure.md](docs/replicate-in-azure.md). It first requires
`protectedItemsCount=0`, removes read-only response members, changes only
`tieringPolicy.ArchivedRP`, and records a pre/post non-tiering diff. Then run audit → bounded apply →
apply again and expect `WouldEnableTierRecommended` → `EnabledAndVerified`
(`writesSubmitted=1`, `policiesWritten=1`) → `AlreadyCompliant` (`policiesWritten=0`).

## Teardown

The default walkthrough removes temporary writer access and leaves the reader and inspection
resources alive. For a dedicated Automation-only group, use its [guarded teardown](docs/replicate-in-azure.md#11-optional-teardown)
to inspect current ownership, remove the two custom roles and assignments, delete the group, and
wait for confirmed deletion. An originally empty fixture may have changed since deployment.
If the group is shared with the Policy showcase, use the combined guide's coordinated cleanup.

## What has been validated

- **1.0, live (2026-08-24):** resource-group and subscription audit / apply / idempotence cycles on
  two empty V1 policies; `DoNotTier` → `TierRecommended`; schedule and retention unchanged;
  repeated apply wrote nothing. See [docs/validation.md](docs/validation.md).
- **1.0, live audit (2026-08-25):** an unfiltered resource-group audit selected the
  service-created daily-only `DefaultPolicy` and `EnhancedPolicy` as write candidates — the
  defect that motivated the 1.1 eligibility gate.
- **1.1, offline:** `tests/BehaviorHarness.ps1` runs the real runbook through 45 scenarios
  (classification, filters, guards, pagination, throttling, token refresh, 202 + operation
  tracking, unknown outcomes, byte-stable date strings and tags, structural verification incl.
  sibling tiering members, fail-closed redundancy/protected-item facts, foreign-URL refusal,
  ambiguous-write reconciliation, error isolation).
- **1.1, live (2026-08-25):** unfiltered audit (daily-only defaults skipped as ineligible), `DoNotTier`
  → `TierRecommended` apply with post-write verification, idempotent repeat, and the whitespace /
  unfiltered / misspelled-name guards all failing closed before any write — as an additional runbook in
  the same Automation Account. Details in [docs/validation.md](docs/validation.md).
- **1.1, fresh live replica (2026-08-31):** published bytes matched source, RG-only audit → bounded
  apply → idempotent repeat produced `1/0/0` → `1/1/1` → `0/0/0` candidates/submitted/verified,
  non-tiering pre/post hashes matched, and the writer was removed while the reader-only showcase was
  retained. The no-reader 403 also exposed the pre-summary failure boundary documented above.

## Important limitations

- Only empty Azure VM V1/daily policies have been write-tested live. V2/hourly, tagged, and
  policies protecting real workloads need their own canaries before use; the defaults refuse
  protected policies until `MaxProtectedItemsPerPolicy` is raised.
- SQL Server and SAP HANA policies are skipped.
- The API returned no ETag during validation, so concurrency protection is the structural
  pre-write comparison plus an operator-enforced exclusive change window. Do not run two apply
  jobs against the same vault at once.
- The runbook issues no DELETE, but a policy update is re-applied to every item the policy
  protects, and a retention change can shorten recovery-point lifetime — which is why the write is
  verified to change nothing but `ArchivedRP`. Recovery points moved to the archive tier carry a
  180-day early-deletion charge. Enabling Smart Tiering does not
  guarantee immediate recovery-point movement; Azure's archive eligibility rules still apply.
- Resource Guard / MUA can block the update; the runbook reports the denial per policy and
  continues with the next policy.
- Commercial Azure only. Archive-tier region support and per-recovery-point dependency rules are
  Azure's; the eligibility gate only rules out policies that can never qualify.

See [docs/design-and-limitations.md](docs/design-and-limitations.md) for the full list and the
hardening status.

## Local validation

Run from the repository root on Linux/WSL after installing PowerShell 7.4, Python 3, `jq`, and
Azure CLI/Bicep (installation links are in walkthrough Step 0). These checks do not authenticate to
Azure or deploy resources. Install PSScriptAnalyzer once in your local PowerShell module directory:

```bash
pwsh -NonInteractive -NoProfile -Command 'Install-Module PSScriptAnalyzer -Scope CurrentUser -Repository PSGallery -Force'
```

Then run the checks. The analyzer command below fails when it finds an error or warning.

```bash
set -euo pipefail
python3 scripts/check_public_content.py
pwsh -NonInteractive -NoProfile -File tests/StaticValidation.ps1
pwsh -NonInteractive -NoProfile -File tests/BehaviorHarness.ps1
pwsh -NonInteractive -NoProfile -Command '$findings = @(Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path src/Enable-SmartTiering.ps1 -Severity Error,Warning -ErrorAction Stop); $findings | Format-Table -AutoSize; if ($findings.Count -gt 0) { exit 1 }'
for file in scripts/*.sh; do bash -n "$file"; done
bash tests/ReplicationGuideTrapTest.sh
jq empty infra/rbac/*.json
az bicep build --file infra/test-environment.bicep --stdout > /dev/null
```
